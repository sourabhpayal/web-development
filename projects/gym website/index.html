            </p>
            <p>" It has been almost one year and I have lost weight and increased my strength. I find the coaches super
                motivating and supportive. During the shred I worked with Rohit and he was very motivating and held me
                accountable. The nutritional guidance and meal plans are easy to follow that is realistic and plenty of
                food. Everyone is extremely Supportive, FUN, KNOWLEDGABLE and challenging. "
